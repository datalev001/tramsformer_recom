# Hugging Face Transformers for Retail Recommendations: A Deep Dive into Tabular Data Utilization
Exploring Large Language Models and Attention Mechanisms for Enhanced Customer Purchase Predictions
Transformers are well-known for their capability of analyzing sequence and text data through self-attention mechanisms. In this article, I will explore their potential to enhance recommendation systems in retail settings. Specifically, I will focus on the effectiveness of Hugging Face transformers in managing and improving tabular data.
This study will demonstrate the transformation of traditional tabular data into formats suitable for transformers. We will convert numerical and categorical data into sequence or text-like formats to fully utilize the self-attention capabilities of transformers. Furthermore, we will contrast these transformer-based approaches with traditional recommendation systems, such as collaborative filtering. While collaborative filtering is widely employed, it may not offer as comprehensive insights into consumer behavior as the more sophisticated architecture of transformers allows.
I have explored three different approaches using transformer models to develop recommendation systems for retail environments:
Direct Method with BERT: This method uses textual descriptions of customers and products to generate embeddings. These embeddings are then used to calculate how well the products match the customers' preferences.
Cluster-Based Recommendation with BERT and KMeans: This approach improves the precision of product recommendations by merging text vectorization with product clustering. It is designed to group similar products to enhance the recommendation process.
Direct Recommendation Using GPT-2: This model leverages GPT-2's generative capabilities to predict customer preferences directly from transaction data, without requiring aggregation at the customer level. It analyzes individual interactions and purchases to forecast likely future interests.
